Give me prompts for Cursor, to generate a program that 1) takes user string input as prompt 2) use LangGraph to invoke a Linux expert agent to get linux commands only, no other texts 3) pass the Linux commands to a Linux reviewer agent for review, which gives feedback to the Linux expert agent and ask it to revise it repeat step 2 and 3 until the Linux commands are good 4) then let user review the commands and edit it. 5) if user approves the commands, execute them in a Linux shell, show the shell output to user 6) let user choose if the output should be sent to step 2 to investigate and fix any error, and continue to step 3 etc.
