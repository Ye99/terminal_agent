To design a multi-agent workflow in Cursor using LangGraph that accomplishes your specified tasks, you can follow these structured prompts:

Define the User Input Agent:

Prompt: "Create an agent that accepts a user's string input as a prompt. This agent should capture the user's request and prepare it for processing by a Linux expert agent."
Develop the Linux Expert Agent:

Prompt: "Design a Linux expert agent that, upon receiving a user prompt, generates only the necessary Linux commands to fulfill the request. Ensure the agent's output consists solely of the commands without additional explanatory text."
Implement the Linux Reviewer Agent:

Prompt: "Construct a Linux reviewer agent that evaluates the commands produced by the Linux expert agent. This agent should provide feedback highlighting any errors or improvements needed and request revisions from the Linux expert agent. Establish a loop between the expert and reviewer agents to iterate until the commands are deemed correct."
Facilitate User Review and Editing:

Prompt: "Set up a mechanism that presents the finalized Linux commands to the user for review. Allow the user to edit the commands as they see fit before approval."
Execute Commands Upon User Approval:

Prompt: "Implement a process that, once the user approves the Linux commands, executes them in a Linux shell. Capture the shell's output and display it to the user."
Error Handling and Iterative Refinement:

Prompt: "After displaying the shell output, provide the user with an option to send the output back to the Linux expert agent for further analysis. If the user identifies errors or issues, allow the workflow to return to the command generation and review loop (steps 2 and 3) for refinement."
Additional Considerations:

Multi-Agent Workflow Design: Utilize LangGraph's capabilities to structure the interactions between agents. For instance, a supervisor agent can manage the flow, directing tasks between the user input agent, Linux expert agent, and Linux reviewer agent. This approach aligns with the supervisor architecture pattern discussed in LangGraph's documentation.

Interruptible Processes: Incorporate interrupt nodes to allow user interventions at various stages, such as during the review phase, enabling a human-in-the-loop mechanism for better control and accuracy.

State Management: Define a clear state schema to manage the data flow between agents, ensuring that each agent has access to the necessary context to perform its function effectively.
